# NVIM Config Installation

Note, this is still in its experimental phases. Currently, to use my config files you will need the following installed onto your system.

- Packer
- Curl or Git (for treesitter)
- A C compiler in your path with libstdc++ (for treesitter please visit their github and read Quickstart/Requirements)

## Installation

> Windows makes it a pain to get gcc or cc installed. Just install zig and your good to go!

On windows, you will want to clone this folder into `~\AppData\Local\`
